## CONOPS
1. Take EthicalInjector.exe and inject our fun.dll (payload) into the LoadMe executable
2. Deliver LoadMe program to target and once they run it, we will have presistance
in target machine


## Steps to develop Loader.exe 
1. Design fun.cpp with payload code then build fun.cpp to get fun.dll
2. Load fun.dll into loader.exe using Injector.exe
Sample execution for EthicalInjector.exe: 

EthicalInjector.exe .hello "<pathTo Loader.exe>" "<pathTo fun.dll>"
.hello is the section name to add into the header of Loader.exe
